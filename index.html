                    Jimi Hendrix, Jeff Beck, Eddie Van Halen and Jimmy Page.
                    These are just a few names that come to mind when we hear a great electric guitar solo or rhythm. 
                    These music greats helped usher the popularity and ubiquity of the electric guitar. 
                    But how did this versatile instrument came to be? 
                    Here is a brief history of the birth of the electric guitar.
                </p>
                <p>
                    People had already been thinking about solid-body guitars by the beginning of the 1940s and had begun working on creating them. 
                    However, the first such instrument on the market was by designed by Leo Fender, the famous manufacturer of guitar amplifiers. 
                    Released in 1949, his Fender Esquire is now regarded as the first solid-body guitar.
                    During the 1950s new and innovative instruments were released one after another, 
                    with what we consider the modern electric guitar being (mostly) completed in 1960.
